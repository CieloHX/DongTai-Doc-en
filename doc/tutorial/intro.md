## DongTai IAST

> Empowering DevSecOps Productivity with an Easier and Secure Way


### Introduction

DongTai IAST is the first open source IAST project in the world, which is primarily focused on DevSecOps to help enterprises produce safer and better code over the long run. It provides both options on SaaS and On-premise solutions for enterprises to meet the environmental requirements.

### About Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)

Interactive Application Security Testing (Interactive Application Security Testing) is a new application security testing program proposed by Gartner in 2012. It uses an agent deployed on the web server of the tested application to monitor traffic sent during runtime and analyzes traffic flow to identify security vulnerabilities in real-time. IAST delivers speed by providing test results directly and clearly, and it includes the type of vulnerability and exact location in the source code of the application.

IAST is equivalent to a combination of DAST and SAST, an interrelated runtime security detection technology. It works dynamically to identify issues during production and runs inside the application server where the tool evaluates code concurrently, so it can use in development, QA testing and production phases. IAST tool is designed to address the imperfection of SAST and DAST to improves security testing by providing greater testing accuracy and helps developers fix risk in risks in real-time.

There have two main types of IAST security tools which are "active IAST" and "passive IAST". Let get started to figure out how they work to understand the difference between them. Active IAST is the approach of combines a DAST solution (web scanner) with an agent that works inside the application server. The agent will validate an existing vulnerability from the value provided by web scanner. Passive IAST also requires the instrumentation of the application with an agent in the security testing environment. It will leverage any form of functional testing (input, request, database,.etc.) to collect data and deliver accurate security findings, so it doesnâ€™t require actively running a dedicated test attack.


## The Advantage of DongTai IAST

1."DongTai IAST" is passive IAST, it has the advantage of high accuracy detection and the speed of real-time actionable results.

2."DongTai IAST" does not require to sending specifically designed traffic to conduct the security test.

3."DongTai IAST" does not run dedicated tests attacks, it will not interfere with business operations.

4."DongTai IAST" is designed with a brand-new technical architecture. It breaks the barrier between agents and unify the data format collected, focuses on the collection of runtime data, and using the cloud to perform the detection of vulnerability.

5."DongTai IAST" provides materials of pen testing lab, agent data, and vulnerabilities rule, which allows "DongTai IAST" can analysis and detect vulnerability in real-time within a short time.

6."DongTai IAST" fits perfectly into integrated development environments and issue trackers. It is a valuable ally for enterprises adopting DevOps or DevSecOps by providing fostering speed and automation integration solutions.

7."DongTai IAST" is an open-source project which can enable the creation of custom rules and personalize threat coverage strategies according to specific enterprises and industry's needs.
